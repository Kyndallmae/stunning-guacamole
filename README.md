## About.
This application allows users to search for restaurants that serve tacos anywhere in the United States

## Description.
The application allows the user to enter the city of their choice to have a list of restaurants that serve tacos near that location.

## Challenges
Some challenges we faced were difficulties with committing changes and merging branches as well as creating the JavaScript together. Weather was also a factor as we faced a record setting heat wave and it affected technical connections.
We utilized a combination of VS Code, JavaScript, CSS , and CSS framework UIKit. For APIâ€™s, we utilized Google Places and Random Cat Generator.

## Future Development
For future development, we look to add an option for users to save their favorite restaurants. Also, we want to add a feature for users to leave a review and, add a map to show the locations near them.


## Motivation
Our motivation was that we all love tacos and millions of people do also and there is no application that specifically allows to find restaurants that serve tacos.

## Success
We succeeded as a team to creating a working application and the application working.
